//! Pure-Rust Windows Media Audio codec.
//!
//! **Clean-room rebuild in progress.** This crate is in clean-room
//! rebuild following the OxideAV docs audit dated 2026-05-06. The
//! staged material under `docs/audio/wma/` is:
//!
//! * `wiki/Windows_Media_Audio.wiki` — an 81-line multimedia.cx
//!   orientation snapshot describing the WMA v1/v2 extradata layout
//!   and the deterministic rule that maps `(version, sample_rate)` to
//!   the per-frame MDCT long-block size. Round 1 implemented those.
//! * `wma-bitstream-from-patents.md` — a patents-only structural
//!   trace assembled from the Microsoft USPTO patent corpus
//!   (Malvar-126/380, Chen-162/171, Thumpudi-180/291/743, Koishida-819).
//!   Round 2 (this round) lifts the §2 patent-disclosed
//!   **block-size set `{256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}`** out of the
//!   trace as the [`BlockSize`] typed primitive.
//!
//! Tables (Huffman codebooks, exponent bands, LSP codebook,
//! critical-frequency curves) are not yet staged so the actual
//! bitstream decode path is intentionally absent.
//!
//! ## Public surface
//!
//! * [`Version`] — WMA v1 vs. v2 selector (from container codec ID
//!   `0x160` and `0x161` respectively).
//! * [`WmaHeader`] — parsed combination of container-supplied
//!   `WAVEFORMATEX` fields plus the extradata payload.
//! * [`BlockSize`] — the five patent-disclosed long-block transform
//!   sizes for WMA Standard (`{256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}` samples),
//!   sourced from US7,930,171 (Chen-171) Background. Drawn from
//!   `docs/audio/wma/wma-bitstream-from-patents.md` §2.
//! * [`Error`] — crate-local error type; new variants land as the
//!   pipeline grows.
